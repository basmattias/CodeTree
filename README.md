# CodeTree
An OpenCode Visualizer

CodeTree can import text files from OpenCode containing exported meaning units. It processes those meaning units
into condensed meaning units, and presents them in a list view. Multiple OpenCode files (from different interviews)
can be merged into one single list of condensed meaning units.

The meaning units can then be collected into Code units. Those code units can in turn be organized into categories,
which then can be included in different themes.

The theme tree will then contain the full set of meaning units in its organized tree structure, making it easy to
overview the gathered information in a structured way.

The GUI is currently in Swedish only.
